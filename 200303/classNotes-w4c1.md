## Workspace

## Activity - Themes [ 645 ]
- Jelly beans, inspired by this week's archetype, turn out to be a potent metaphor for web design: A container that is snacky, approachable, and easily apprehended. All qualities we pursue as web designers.
- Jester, according to some of this week's archetypal research, illustrates the same spectrum of outcomes as the jelly bean. In a thoughtful space, both are about enjoyment. In an extreme space, both bring to bear qualities of excess and overindulgence.
