- Demo page: https://codepen.io/codeyourheartout/pen/WNvWLYY

## Assignment

### Form design essentials
- Design three HTML forms that demonstrate your knowledge of HTML form elements and CSS styling.
- Each form should be designed as its own CodePen.
- Your three HTML forms should be responses to any of the following five prompts:

1. Form that serves as a ten-question Q&A interview form. The form asks interesting questions designed to let the user explain his/her/their work or interests. Think about really great icebreaking or intriguing questions!
2. Form that serves as a five-question true-or-false quiz. Make the quiz topic about web design.
3. Form that serves as a tool to manage the addition of items to a grocery list.
4. Form that serves as an assessment checklist for tracking a patient's coronavirus symptoms
5. Form that serves as a tool to schedule gym workout visits and activity

- Requirements for each form: Demonstrate (1) use of a properly formatted HTML form tag, specifying a method; (2) use of any HTML form organizer tag (fieldset, legend, or label) in a logical way at least once; (3) proper use of a submit button, both in function and in aesthetic; (4) use at least two other HTML form tags of any kind, (5) artful inclusion of at least three CSS styles, and (6) visual design approach that presents the form with a cohesive sense of balance, aesthetics, and style.
- When you are done designing your forms, create a fourth CodePen menu page that presents links to your three HTML forms.
- Submit the menu page as your coursework link
