# Compiling master assignment list
- This is a list of assignments, to date.
- This is a working document. Details are subject to revision.
- Items on this list will be formalized on http://www.Art64X.com/assignments/

## Exercise: Personal Introduction
Convert the Hello World demo into web page presenting personal content

1. Image of a personal nature (hint: use HTML tag img)
2. Name (hint: use HTML tag h1)
3. Label text for the list that follows (hint: use HTML tag h2)
4. List of four items, such as favorite foods (hint: use HTML tag p)

## Exercise (645): Personal Introduction
Convert the Hello World demo into web page presenting personal content

Requirements of final output:
1. Image of a personal nature (hint: use HTML tag img)
2. Name (hint: use HTML tag h1)
3. Label text for the list that follows (hint: use HTML tag h2)
4. List of four items, such as favorite foods (hint: use HTML tag p)

Image should be sourced from an absolute URL because CodePen cannot host images.

Complete the work done on this exercise in Notepad, and post it as a pen to your new CodePen account.

## Exercise (645): Create free CodePen account

## Exercise (646): Create free PHPfiddle account

## Exercise (all): Use Art64X.com/upload

## Exercise (646): Die roll as dynamic content
Using today's demo of PHP as a starting point, develop a PHP app that simulates the rolling of a die.

- Write the entire script in PHP Fiddle
- Use the rand() function to generate a number
- Use the switch() statement to map the generated number to a corresponding image
- Use HTML to present the app's user interface
- The user interface should contain (1) the die roll result and (2) a button or link that initiates a new roll by refreshing the page
- Images should be sourced from absolute URLs because PHP Fiddle cannot host images
- If you wish, you can deviate from the die motif and design the web app to present some other set of images randomly

Complete the work done on this exerise in PHP Fiddle, and post it as a pen to your new CodePen account. Note this PHP app will not work in CodePen, but at least you have saved it and can host the file somewhere else later.

The demo can be viewed at http://www.codeyourheartout.com/examples/randomDieRoll/ and the code can be downloaded at https://github.com/PresentLocation/randomDieRoll
