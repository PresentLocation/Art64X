# Lesson Plan

- This week's archetype: DIVA
- Today's topic: CONTRAST

## Workspace

- 646: Special intervention of workspace time to introduce today's activity: variations on diceroll, and introducing array().

## Lecture - Contrast
- Mapping the use of contrast in typography (form or color: light/dark), color (foreground/background), and sizing (large/small)
- High contrast for separation effect
- Low contrast for blending effect

## Demo [ 645 ]- Essential methods of working with image
- Building blocks of the visual web: https://codepen.io/codeyourheartout/pen/YzXWePm
- Building methods of the visual web: foreground element, background element, layered element
- Use of common image production tools: Photoshop vs Photopea
- Use of essential HTML5: img, div, background-image, position, z-index, top, bottom, right, left

## Demo [ 646 ] - Basic PHP
- Refactor Dice Roll exercise utilizing more compact logic, shifting from a control structure approach to concatenation approach.
- New PHP: array()
- New PHP: concatenation: "."
- New PHP: querystring: $_GET[]
- New PHP" if/else

### More Diva [ 645 ]
- Challenge: Rework your Personal Introduction using the contrast principle of visual design
- Setup process: Access your work in the course /pages/. View source code. Copy source code. Start new CodePen Pen. Paste copied code into Pen.
- Study process: For every design element in your existing design, (a) identify the element, and (b) decide on a contrast approach that will determine how you rework that element. Document all of this study process in a comment tag.
- Design work: Apply your selected contrast approaches to your rework.
- Requirement: Do not change any content. You may change the contrast approach of the presentation, but not the content itself. If your design concept requires, you may leave certain content elements out completely.
- Objective: The rework should offer a revised design that is more visually impactful.
