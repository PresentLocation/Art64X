# Class Notes
- This week's archetype: DIVA
- Today's topic: CONTRAST

## Class intro
- Divas: 2
- Diva stories: 1

## Workspace
- 645: Open lab
- 646: Special intervention of workspace time to introduce today's activity: adapting Dice Roll exercise into Archetype app.

## Demo [ 646 ] - Basic PHP
- Refactor Dice Roll exercise utilizing more compact logic, shifting handling of random key from a control structure approach to concatenation approach.
- New concept: Refactoring
- New PHP: array()
- New PHP: concatenation: "."
- Demonstration: Refactoring switch logic
- Demo results: http://www.Art64X.com/pages/phpDemoRandomArchetype.php
- Demo source code: https://github.com/PresentLocation/Art64X/blob/master/200220/phpDemoRandomArchetype.php

## Lecture - Contrast
- Contrast establishes difference. Difference invites comparison. Comparison activates engagement. 
- Review the use of contrast in typography (light/dark, large/small, ornate/clean), color (foreground/background, tint/shade), size (large/small), and space (close/far, low/high, etc.)
- Review critique of Ana, David, Anthony.
- Intelligent use of contrast theory in design decisions can make the design more engaging. This can contribute to various success vectors including accessibility, memorable, convincing, aesthetically pleasing.
- Work session: utilize contrast revision approach to make improvements to design's effectiveness. This approach quantifies and qualifies aesthetics vis-a-vis purpose.
- Takeaway: Design is not an arbitrary or vanity act.

## Syllabus review
- Access the syllabus here: http://www.art64X.com/syllabus
- Acessible version is 100% content, 0% design. Look how inaccessible it is without design.
- Takeaway: Design is important. Design gives content value.
- We will review and work on the syllabus next week.

## End-of-week archetype activity
- Pick next week's archetype
- Vote via described voting method. Vote serves as attendance record for today's class.

## Activities today

- Requirement: App should present selected archetypes in a way that is visually non-hierarchical
- Use php rand()
- Use one of the following in some way: php switch, php array()
- Use all of the following html tags in some way: a, img, div

### More Diva [ 645 ]
- Challenge: Rework your Personal Introduction using the contrast principle of visual design
- Setup process: Access your work in the course /pages/. View source code. Copy source code. Start new CodePen Pen. Paste copied code into Pen.
- Study process: For every design element in your existing design, (a) identify the element, and (b) decide on a contrast approach that will determine how you rework that element. Document all of this study process in a comment tag.
- Design work: Apply your selected contrast approaches to your rework.
- Requirement: Do not change any content. You may change the contrast approach of the presentation, but not the content itself. If your design concept requires, you may leave certain content elements out completely.
- Objective: The rework should offer a revised design that is more visually impactful.
