## Activity - Mastermind
- Reference: https://www.careerexplorer.com/archetypes/mastermind/
- Collaborative framework for research and analysis: (1) qualities/attributes, (2) examples, (3) opportunities, (4) be aware.
- New HTML tags for making lists: ul, li
- Collaboration results of research and analysis: https://codepen.io/codeyourheartout/pen/MWwpyXJ
- Design work: Translate research and analysis into assets and content for a web design activity presenting this archetype via the web panel with composited elements.

## Lecture/Demo: Designing "Big Picture" elements with the composited HTML5 web panel
- Compositing is the arrangement of elements as layered on top of each other. Similar to layers function in Photoshop or Illustrator which allows the graphic designer to visually composite elements into a singular work.
- The composited arrangement happens in a special HTML layout mode that is different from HTML's default layout mode of stacking elements from top to bottom of document.
- HTML5 compositing uses 2D layout controls to achieve sense of 3D perspective
- Compositing design elements can provide a way to bring visual elements into close enough proximity to tell a story visually
- A composited element can provide a big picture visual to an overall design
- Unlike large graphic assets, a composited element can be further programmed to present unique interactive or animated behaviors
- Use of HTML5 div https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div
- Activate the special layout mode with use of CSS position with relative and absolute https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp
- This special layout mode is formally known as stacking context https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context
- Use of CSS z-index https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index
- Use of CSS top, right, bottom, left https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/t/top-right-bottom-left/
- Final version of demo, using Mastermind archetype work as content: https://codepen.io/codeyourheartout/pen/WNvppYL?editors=1000

## Activity - Archetype app
- Finalize front end designs. Make sure the app looks like a self-contained experience.
- Remove all elements that are residue from demo work.
- Ensure primary functionality -- displaying three archetypes at random -- works.
- Develop secondary functionality, namely the addition of HTML radio buttons that give user a way to vote on one of the presented archetypes.
